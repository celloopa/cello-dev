## Overview

Veg Avengers Marketing is a web platform dedicated to promoting vegan causes and animal rights advocacy. The site serves as a discovery hub for vegan festivals (VegFests), animal sanctuaries, and featured organizations—helping users connect with the vegan community and support animal welfare initiatives.

## The Resource Discovery System

The core feature is an intelligent search system that helps users find VegFests by date, location, or month, and discover animal sanctuaries by region. The animated ResourceToggle lets users seamlessly switch between search modes with smooth slide and fade transitions.

]} />

## Smart Search Features

The search system handles complex date formats, supports month-based filtering (e.g., searching "March" or "3"), and uses location synonyms so users can search "UK" and find results for "United Kingdom," "England," or "GB." Results are categorized into upcoming, TBD (unconfirmed), and past events.

## Featured Projects Showcase

A responsive grid showcases featured vegan organizations and sanctuaries, including Juliana's Animal Sanctuary and Rowdy Girl Sanctuary. Each card features staggered entry animations, hover effects, and multiple call-to-action buttons.

## Technical Highlights

- **Astro Islands Architecture**: React components hydrate only where needed, keeping static pages fast
- **Server-Side Rendering**: API routes handle search queries with Astro DB (SQLite-based)
- **Framer Motion Animations**: Smooth transitions, staggered reveals, and interactive hover states
- **Persistent Preferences**: localStorage saves search queries across sessions
- **Yearly Data Model**: Scalable structure for adding new festival data each year
