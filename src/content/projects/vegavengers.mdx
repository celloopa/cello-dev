## Overview

VegAvengers Marketing needed a modern, performant website to showcase VegFests and animal sanctuaries across the country. The site required searchable, filterable components that could handle large datasets while maintaining a smooth user experience.

<MediaFull src="/images/projects/sanctuary.webm" caption="Real-time sanctuary search" />

## Challenge

The main challenge was creating a search system that could filter through hundreds of events and sanctuaries in real-time while keeping the interface responsive on mobile devices.

<MediaTwo items={[
  { src: "/images/projects/sanctuary.webm", caption: "Mobile view" },
  { src: "/images/projects/sanctuary.webm", caption: "Desktop view" }
]} />

## Solution

Built a React/TypeScript application with Vite for fast development and optimized builds. Implemented a custom search component with debounced filtering and lazy-loaded results to ensure smooth performance even on slower connections.

<MediaThree items={[
  { src: "/images/projects/sanctuary.webm", alt: "Feature 1" },
  { src: "/images/projects/sanctuary.webm", alt: "Feature 2" },
  { src: "/images/projects/sanctuary.webm", alt: "Feature 3" }
]} />

## Results

- Fast initial load times with code splitting
- Responsive design that works seamlessly across all devices
- Intuitive search interface that helps users find events quickly
